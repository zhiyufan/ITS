## Lecture 9: Debugging
[slides](slides/lectures/Lec9-Debugging-short.pdf), [recording](https://youtu.be/pTVcRWCWRtg)

In this lecture, we continued with our discussions on testing and analysis. Some background material on software debugging was presented, including slicing and fault localisation.


## Lecture 10: Non-functional issues: Security and Timeliness
[slides 1](slides/lectures/Lec9-Taint.pdf), [slides 2](slides/lectures/Lec11-Timeliness.pdf), [recording](https://youtu.be/yDsZukcZL-k)  

In this lecture, we discussed software performance issues and timing-critical software design.


## Lecture 11: Invitation Talks
