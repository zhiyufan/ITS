## Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) of Programming Education

![ITS](../icons/its.svg)

The high-level idea of the Intelligent Tutoring System is to introduce an automated technique to provide feedback and grading suggestions for programming assignments. As shown in the above figure, for a given programming assignment, the tutor would provide a reference solution and some test cases, while the student would submit a solution and receive feedback. The feedback should go beyond the simple execution of test cases and tell the student where and how to fix the submission. More sophisticated and gradual ways of feedback could also be introduced.
