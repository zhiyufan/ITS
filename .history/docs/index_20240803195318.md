In Computer Science (CS) education, we face the challenge of increasing student enrollments over the past few years. Consequently, it has become increasingly difficult to provide high-quality and individualized learning support, particularly for novice students. Mirhosseini et al. recently conducted an interview study with CS instructors to identify their biggest pain points. Among other issues, they found that CS instructors struggle with limited or no Teaching Assistant (TA) support and the generally time-consuming task of providing student feedback and grading assignments. Thus, CS instructors would greatly benefit from automating tutoring activities to support TAs in their responsibilities.

Despite prior research from automated program repair and synthesis demonstrating the potential of automated feedback and grading in programming courses, these systems are not yet widely adopted in CS education. The main reasons include their prototype nature, difficulty of use, and lack of evolution. Additionally, this line of work inevitably exposes too many details (i.e., direct fixes of errors) to students, which may hinder the learning process. Conversely, recent advancements in large language models have also revolutionized automated feedback systems in computer science education. These systems typically focus on prompting large language models (LLMs) for specific teaching scenarios, such as question-answering for lecture topics. However, they heavily rely on LLM output, which is known to be prone to hallucinations and is not always reliable. Such randomness in the generated feedback can lead to confusion and frustration among students.

In this work, we report our design principles and the architecture of an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) for programming education that synergizes the strengths of both approaches. The ITS first searches for precise bug-fixing patches with a hybrid program repair engine, and then ITS invokes LLM to use those patches as guidance to pinpoint students' conceptual misunderstandings and provide more reliable feedback. The key is to bridge the gap between accurate low-level fixing by program analysis and knowledgeable high-level explanations by LLMs. Figure~\ref{fig:its-idea} illustrates the general concept of the Intelligent Tutoring System. The lecturer provides reference programs and test cases as specifications of a programming assignment, and students submit their solutions to the ITS. The ITS then automatically fixes the studentâ€™s code if it is incorrect and elaborates on the fixes to provide high-level feedback as hints, gradually guiding the student to understand the foundational reason for the error. Additionally, the ITS provides a grading support system that automatically grades student submissions for lecturers.





The high-level idea of the Intelligent Tutoring System is to introduce an automated technique to provide feedback and grading suggestions for programming assignments. As shown in the above figure, for a given programming assignment, the tutor would provide a reference solution and some test cases, while the student would submit a solution and receive feedback. The feedback should go beyond the simple execution of test cases and tell the student where and how to fix the submission. More sophisticated and gradual ways of feedback could also be introduced.
