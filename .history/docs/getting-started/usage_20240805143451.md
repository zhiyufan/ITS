## Example Programming Assignment

Let's consider a simple programming assignment where students are asked to write a C program that calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. The program should take an integer `n` as input and output the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. 

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
  int i,j,n,sum=0;
  scanf("%d",&n);  
  for(i=1;i<=n;i++){
    for(j=1;j<=i;j++){
      sum+=j;
    }
  }
  printf("%d",sum);
  return 0;
}    
```
